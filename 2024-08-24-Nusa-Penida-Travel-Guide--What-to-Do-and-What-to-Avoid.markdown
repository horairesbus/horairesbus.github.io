Understanding and respecting the local culture will enhance your travel experience. Participate in local events if possible, and consider visiting traditional villages to gain insight into the lives of the Balinese people. This respectful engagement fosters goodwill and can lead to genuine interactions with the local community, making your trip even more meaningful.
