Here's the topics Discussed from the Dec 5, 2023 edition of The Ronin Radio:

Apeiron, a new god game, has joined the Ronin ecosystem. The CEO Frank discussed the game which involves shaping planets with elements like water, earth, fire and air. There are also PvE and soon to be PvP battles in a roguelike and card game hybrid.

Apeiron worlds can be purchased on OpenSea. Older worlds that are aged have advantages like generating more resources and accessing more game features.  There are free to play options for players who cannot afford to buy worlds. They can join guilds who will provide them with planets to play the game.
