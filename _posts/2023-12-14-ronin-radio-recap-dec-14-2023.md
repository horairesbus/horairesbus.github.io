Dynamic NFTs & Collectible Axie:
The new collectible Axie reward system allows collectible Axies to earn fortune slips, which can be used to get rewards like AXP. The supply of collectible Axies is limited which means the supply of fortune slips is also limited. This could drive up the value of collectible Axies. This adds tangible value to collectible Axies and makes them an important part of the ecosystem. 
The dynamic NFTs concept means Axies will evolve and change as you play with them and invest resources into them. Part evolutions and the new materials system are expected to add depth and complexity to the Axie experience by allowing Axies to evolve. Coco-Cocoa can be used to level up Axies while Radiant Shells will be used for part evolutions.

AXP Limitations and Farming: 
The AXP cap per day increases as you level up your Axies, limiting how quickly whales can level up. Players will have to optimize earning AXP through different means like using Coco-Cocoa and playing different games.

Delegation tools are in the works and would allow players to delegate their Axies and contract actions to others, improving efficiency and could enable players to farm AXP for each other.

Origin Season 7
Season 7 of Origins will feature balance updates and part evolutions could potentially be part of it. Competitive players may need to level up their Axies to level 30 to compete at the highest level.  The balance updates for Origin Season 7 are still being tested and all changes will be published at the end of the month.
