Apeiron Makes Official Migration to Ronin Blockchain

In a groundbreaking move, Apeiron has successfully migrated its operations from Polygon to the Ronin blockchain. The renowned gaming company is thrilled about the support received from industry giants Sky Mavis and the Ronin network. This migration brings a multitude of advantages, including what insiders are calling the "Ronin effect."

Apeiron's gaming experience revolves around both player-versus-environment (PvE) and player-versus-player (PvP) gameplay. However, PvP takes center stage as the testing period has begun for those holding the respective assets. The team at Apeiron places great importance on competitive gameplay and ensuring a well-balanced environment. To achieve this, CEO Frank has reached out to the community, urging players to actively participate in testing the game and providing valuable feedback for fine-tuning.

Players will have the opportunity to acquire NFTs in the PvE experience. Apostles collected give you a choice of 1 mint per play through. Finding out more on Star NFTs, we learned that they enhance land ownership and grant planets the ability to orbit, age faster, which is advantageous for those building guilds and strong alliances in game.

Apeiron has also rolled out exciting content creator programs, offering enticing incentives of up to $2,700 in rewards. These incentives are based on various factors, including player acquisition and boss kills in PvE. The Apeiron team is wholeheartedly committed to supporting creators who actively engage with and immerse themselves in the game.

Apeiron advises creators to focus on producing captivating content that resonates with their audience. By delving into the intricate details of the game, creators can share information to prospective players. Content creators are encouraged to join the Apeiron community on Discord.
