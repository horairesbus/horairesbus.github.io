Apeiron Migration:
Apeiron has migrated from Polygon to Ronin blockchain officially. They are excited about the support from Sky Mavis and the Ronin network, which brings many advantages like the "Ronin effect". 

The game focuses on both PvE and PvP gameplay with PvP being the core of the economy.  Competitive gameplay and balancing is a priority.  Frank, the Apeiron CEO, requested the community test and provide feedback to help balance and fine tune the game.

Players can obtain planet and apostle NFTs which have utilities within the game like staking and equipping gear.  Star NFTs represent land in the game and allow planets to orbit, age faster and join guilds.
