### Historical Significance
The Forbidden City was the political nucleus of China for over five centuries, from the Ming dynasty until the abdication of the last emperor, Puyi, in 1912. Originally constructed as a symbol of imperial power, it was not just a residence for emperors but also the heart of administrative and ceremonial life. The complex bore witness to critical historical events, including rebellions, foreign invasions, and significant political shifts. Its architectural design reflects the rigidly hierarchical nature of Chinese society and the emperor's divine status. The transition from imperial rule to a republic marked a profound turning point in its history, transforming the Forbidden City from a royal residence to a museum that encapsulates the essence of China's imperial legacy. This historical journey highlights the importance of the site in understanding the evolution of modern China.
### Architectural Marvel
The architecture of the Forbidden City is a testament to the ingenuity and artistry of traditional Chinese design. Covering an area of 72 hectares, the complex consists of nearly 1,000 buildings, each showcasing intricate details and symbolic elements. The roofs are adorned with yellow glazed tiles, a color reserved for the emperor, representing his imperial status. The layout of the Forbidden City adheres to strict [Feng Shui](https://fr.edu.vn/en/Feng_shui) principles, emphasizing balance and harmony. The central axis of the city is meticulously planned, reinforcing the importance of symmetry and order in Chinese culture. The architectural features, such as ornate wooden beams, intricate carvings, and vibrant colors, not only reflect aesthetic beauty but also convey deeper cultural meanings. The design of the Forbidden City has had a lasting influence on architectural practices throughout East Asia, inspiring generations of builders and artists.
### The Layout of the Forbidden City
The Forbidden City is thoughtfully divided into two main sections: the Outer Court and the Inner Court. The Outer Court, primarily used for ceremonial purposes, houses significant halls such as the Hall of Supreme Harmony, where grand ceremonies took place. In contrast, the Inner Court served as the emperor's residence and the center of daily administrative life. This division not only reflects the functional aspects of the palace but also symbolizes the emperor's dual role as both a political ruler and a spiritual leader. The layout facilitates a clear distinction between public and private spaces, allowing for the performance of state rituals while maintaining the sanctity of the emperor's home life. This thoughtful design is indicative of the careful planning that characterized the construction of the Forbidden City, ensuring that it met the needs of both governance and personal life.
### Cultural Relics and Artifacts

With over 1.8 million pieces, the museum's collection includes paintings, ceramics, historical documents, and intricate artworks. Many of these artifacts were evacuated during times of conflict and are now displayed in various museums, including the National Palace Museum in Taipei. The preservation of these relics plays a crucial role in safeguarding Chinese history and culture. Each piece tells a story, allowing visitors to connect with the past and understand the significance of the imperial court in shaping Chinese civilization. The museum not only serves as a repository of history but also as a platform for cultural exchange, showcasing the artistic achievements of a bygone era.
