Congratulations to the Guildless Gamers who finished in the top 1000 in Season 6! We have a total of 30 GG members!

We have 5 individuals in the top 100, with PotatoChips securing the second spot! PotatoChips is the highest-ranking Guildless Gamer on the leaderboard, an outstanding achievement. Among the top 500, we have 16 finishers, including some new names as well as many familiar faces from previous seasons. Lastly, we have 9 finishers in the ranks 501-1000. A commendable effort by all.

Now, it's time to take a well-earned rest as the Offseason begins. Let's eagerly await news about Season 7.
