Hello World! I’m Donjet Rexhepi and I have a degree in Computer Science and Business Development. Previously, I worked as an IT auditor and wrote my undergraduate thesis on privacy and security for connected and autonomous vehicles, focusing on how blockchain and differential privacy can protect personal data.

My passion for information security and cybersecurity has grown significantly, which led me to start this blog. Here, I’ll share my thoughts, conduct research and document my learning journey in cybersecurity as a beginner. Join me as I explore this exciting field!
