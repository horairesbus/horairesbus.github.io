My name is Shatha Almazrouei. I'm currently a sophomore at NYUAD. I'm just someone who is trying to figure out what to do in life. Meanwhile, I really enjoy the small things that leave an impact, such as this website that I hope I will visit 5 to 10 years from now and be proud of the things I created. Also, this page is for viewers who are interested in my works and projects. ðŸ™‚
