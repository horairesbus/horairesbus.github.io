## Setting Goals
<a id="setting-goals"></a>

### Defining objectives for Guildless Gamers - build a strong community that holds through bear and bull runs
- Forefront of Web3 gaming through offering growth consultancy services where we break down pain points in a highly dynamic space through our experience as active Web3 gamers and understanding growth through content creation.
- Highly established network in order to conduct background checks on Web2 and Web3 developers to thoroughly understand the capabilities behind a team and if they are able to execute on their promises.<br>

### Who do we build for and what value do we bring to the table
- Game balance team - Tokenomics - our 3 years of experience with multiple Web3 titles has given us insight on why and how systems thrive or fail and what triggers growth or decline.
- Game balance - Field test from gamers - we can field test games on the go and collect feedback from multiple target markets. We can target collectors who enjoy the collection aspect of games, hardcore competitive gamers who enjoy showing up at the top of the leaderboards
- Content creators - we can analyze for content creator which games are most enjoyable for them and unique ways for them to break into the market with their content with specific niches.
- Game growth - apps development - we have many different types of developers inside the Guildless Gamers discord and we can see that when indie developers first build out their games there isnâ€™t a lot of support for tools for player base which would greatly enhance their gameplay experience. We have experienced developers that we can leverage their knowledge to recommend to Web3 games.
