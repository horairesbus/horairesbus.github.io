### Climate and Weather
Surabaya is characterized by a tropical climate, which means hot and humid conditions year-round.

July and August are particularly favorable for sightseeing, as the weather is cooler and less humid. However, even during these months, the midday sun can be intense, making sun protection essential for outdoor activities.

The rainy season usually occurs from November to March, when sudden downpours can provide a refreshing break from the heat, although this can also disrupt plans. It's wise to check weather forecasts before planning excursions.

Navigating Surabaya can be a bit challenging, particularly due to its complicated public transport system.
